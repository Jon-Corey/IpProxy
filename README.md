# IP Proxy

This is a proxy meant for use by [Device Info](https://github.com/Jon-Corey/DeviceInfo). It forwards a request to [IP-API](https://ip-api.com/)'s free-tier non-SSL API. This proxy is intended to allow clients to get the data from [IP-API](https://ip-api.com/) without having to make a request to a non-SSL resource (which the browser blocks on HTTPS sites).
